# ![](https://github.com/tstamborski/pixelart-icons/blob/main/png/famicom64.png) NES Miscellaneous Examples 
Set of NES/Famicom/Pegasus/Dendy programming examples made in the ca65 assembler.
## Overview
This is a set of programming examples which I have made for my own educational purposes and I want to share them with others. I try to keep them possibly educational friendly to everybody, so there are always a few comments in english. All examples are made with __ca65__ assembler which is a part of the [__cc65__](https://cc65.github.io) package. All graphics (tiles/nametables/palettes) are made with [__NEXXT__](https://frankengraphics.itch.io/nexxt).
